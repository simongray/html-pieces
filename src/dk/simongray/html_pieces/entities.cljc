  "The named character references of HTML, such as &amp; and &eacute;, by
  the table in section 13.5 of the HTML Standard.

  The table is the entities.json that WHATWG publishes with the standard,
  as of 2026-10-08, under CC BY 4.0. It's read when the namespace
  compiles, so ClojureScript carries it as one string.

  Only the names of HTML 4.01 are kept, with &apos; of XML and the legacy
  names that HTML reads without a semicolon: 365 of the 2,231 names. The
  rest came to HTML from MathML, such as &NotEqualTilde;, and a reference
  to one of them stays text. They would make the table eight times as
  large, and no show notes in a corpus of real podcast feeds use one.

  TODO: read the names from MathML too, by an option or a namespace of
  their own, for HTML that writes mathematics with them."
