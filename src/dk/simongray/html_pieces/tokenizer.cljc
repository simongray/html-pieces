  The tokenizer is for HTML embedded in other content, so it leaves out
  what only whole documents and SVG or MathML need. Each part ends where
  the standard ends it, so no other token changes:

  - a DOCTYPE runs to the next >, without its name, identifiers or the
    force-quirks flag, 13.2.5.53 to 13.2.5.68
  - <? starts a bogus comment, as before the processing instructions of
    13.2.5.72 to 13.2.5.76
  - a CDATA section is a bogus comment, as it is outside SVG and MathML,
    without the CDATA states of 13.2.5.69 to 13.2.5.71

  TODO: read these too, by an option or a namespace of their own, for a
