  A parse gives a sequence of nodes. An element is a vector of a keyword
  tag, a map of keyword attributes and its children, and text is a string.
  For HTML that a client can render, use the hiccup function. It parses
  and sanitizes HTML, and makes paragraphs of plain text. The text and
  markdown functions render HTML or Hiccup as text, and emit writes Hiccup
  back as HTML.
